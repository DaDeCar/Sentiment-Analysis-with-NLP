# Project: Sentiment Analysis with NLP
Sentiment Analysis on Movies Reviews

Basically a sentiment analysis problem consists of a classification problem, where the possible output labels are: `positive` and `negative`. Which indicates, if the review of a movie speaks positively or negatively. 


Regarding the data, we are going to download the data from [AI Stanford Dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/).

### These are the objectives of the project:

* Read data that is not in a traditional format.

* Put together a set of preprocessing functions that we can use later on any NLP or related problems.

* Vectorize the data in order to apply a machine learning model to it: using BoW or TF-IDF.

* Train a sentiment analysis model that allows us to detect positive and negative opinions in movie reviews.
